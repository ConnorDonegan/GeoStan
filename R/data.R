#' @description A simple features spatial dataset containing county attributes and Presidential election data for Ohio.
#'  This is a processed version of the MIT "County Presidential Election Returns 2000-2016" data set augmented with data from the American Community Survey and Bureau of Labor Statistics.
#'
#' @details The Bureau of Labor Statistics unemployment estimates are based on the ACS estimates as well as additional information. The BLS estimates were used for the analysis in Donegan et al. (2020). The ACS estimates have standard errors (the BLS estimates do not).
