The **geostan** R package provides a user-friendly interface to
hierarchical Bayesian models (HBMs) for spatial and spatio-temporal data. It is designed for
relative ease of use and developed with a particular emphasis on spatial epidemiology and survey data for public health.
All of the models are built with RStan, but users only need to be familiar with the R language.

The package and webiste are still under development.

## Features

### Spatial analysis tools

Tools for visualizing and measuring spatial autocorrelation and map patterns, for exploratory analysis and model diagnostics.

### Spatial regression 

Models for continuous and count data recorded across areal units like counties or census tracts.

### Disease mapping and spatial demography

Model small-area incidence rates with mortality or disease data.

### Spatio-temporal models

Model spatial processes unfolding over time.

### Observational error models 

Incorporate information on data quality into any **geostan** model. Purpose-built for social, economic, and health surveys such as the American Community Survey (ACS).

### The RStan ecosystem

Compatible with a suite of high-quality R packages for Bayesian inference and model evaluation.
