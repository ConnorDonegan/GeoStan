Bayesian Spatial Analysis
-------------------------

The **geostan** R package provides a user-friendly interface to
hierarchical Bayesian models (HBMs) for areal data. It is designed for
ease of use with a particular emphasis on spatial epidemiology and survey data. All of the
models are fit using the Stan probabilistic programming language. The
package is still under development, you see more on the [package website](connordonegan.github.io/geostan)
