\title{Edge list}
\usage{
edges(w)
}
\arguments{
\item{w}{A connectivity matrix where connection between two nodes is indicated by non-zero entries.}
}
\value{
Returns a \code{data.frame} with two columns representing connected pairs of nodes; only unique pairs of nodes are included.
}
\description{
Creates a list of connected nodes following the graph representation of a spatial connectivity matrix.
}
\details{
This is used internally for  \link[geostan]{stan_icar} and \link[geostan]{stan_bym2}; it is also needed to create the scaling factor for \code{stan_bym2}.
