\arguments{
\item{formula}{A model formula, following the R \link[stats]{formula} syntax. Binomial models are specified by setting the left hand side of the equation to a data frame of successes and failures, as in \code{cbind(successes, failures) ~ x}.}

\item{slx}{Formula to specify any spatially-lagged covariates. As in, \code{~ x1 + x2} (the intercept term will be removed internally).
These will be pre-multiplied by a row-standardized spatial weights matrix and then added (prepended) to the design matrix.
If and when setting priors for \code{beta} manually, remember to include priors for any SLX terms as well.}

\item{re}{If the model includes a varying intercept specify the grouping variable here using formula syntax, as in \code{~ ID}. The resulting random effects parameter returned is named \code{alpha_re}.}

\item{data}{A \code{data.frame} or an object coercible to a data frame by \code{as.data.frame} containing the model data.}

\item{C}{Spatial connectivity matrix which will be used to calculate eigenvectors, residual spatial autocorrelation as well as any user specified \code{slx} terms or spatial measurement error (ME) models; it will be row-standardized before calculating \code{slx} terms.}

\item{EV}{A matrix of eigenvectors from any (transformed) connectivity matrix, presumably spatial. If provided, still also provide a spatial weights matrix \code{C} for other purposes.  See \link[geostan]{make_EV} and \link[geostan]{shape2mat}.}

\item{ME}{To model observational uncertainty (i.e. measurement or sampling error) in any or all of the covariates, provide a named list. Errors are assigned a Gaussian probability distribution and the modeled (true) covariate vector is assigned a Student's t model or, if \code{ME$spatial = TRUE}, an auto Gaussian (CAR) model. Elements of the list \code{ME} may include:
\describe{

\item{se}{a dataframe with standard errors for each observation; columns will be matched to the variables by column names. The names should match those from the output of \code{model.matrix(formula, data)}.}
\item{bounded}{If any variables in \code{se} are bounded within some range (e.g. percentages ranging from zero to one hundred) provide a vector of zeros and ones indicating which columns are bounded. By default the lower bound will be 0 and the upper bound 100, for percentages.}
\item{bounds}{A numeric vector of length two providing the upper and lower bounds, respectively, of any bounded variables.}
\item{spatial}{Logical value indicating whether an auto Gaussian (i.e., conditional autoregressive (CAR)) model should be used for the covariates. For \code{stan_esf}, this defaults to \code{spatial = TRUE}. If \code{spatial = TRUE} you must provide \code{car_parts} (see below).}
\item{car_parts}{A list of data for the CAR model, as returned by \link[geostan]{prep_car_data} (be sure to return the matrix \code{C}, by using the argument \code{cmat = TRUE}). Only required if \code{spatial=TRUE}.}
}}

\item{nsa}{Include eigenvectors representing negative spatial autocorrelation? Default \code{nsa = FALSE}. Ignored if \code{EV} is provided.}

\item{threshold}{Threshold for eigenvector MC value; eigenvectors with values below threshold will be excluded from the candidate set. Default \code{threshold = 0.25}; ignored if \code{EV} is provided.}

\item{family}{The likelihood function for the outcome variable. Current options are \code{family = gaussian()}, \code{student_t()} and \code{poisson(link = "log")}, and \code{binomial(link = "logit")}.}

\item{p0}{Number of eigenvector coefficients expected to be far from zero. If this and \code{prior_rhs} are missing, Chun et al.'s (2016) formula will be used to fill this in; see \link[geostan]{exp_pars}.
The value of \code{p0} is used to control the prior degree of sparsity in the model.}

\item{prior}{A \code{data.frame} or \code{matrix} with location and scale parameters for Gaussian prior distributions on the model coefficients. Provide two columns---location and scale---and a row for each variable in their order of appearance in the model formula. Default priors are weakly informative relative to the scale of the data.}

\item{prior_intercept}{A vector with location and scale parameters for a Gaussian prior distribution on the intercept; e.g. \code{prior_intercept = c(0, 10)}.}

\item{prior_sigma}{A vector with degrees of freedom, location and scale parameters for the half-Student's t prior on the residual standard deviation \code{sigma}. To use a half-Cauchy prior set degrees of freedom to one; e.g. \code{prior_sigma = c(1, 0, 3)}.}

\item{prior_rhs}{A named vector with the degrees of freedom and scale of the zero mean Student's t slab for regularizing large eigenvector coefficients, and the prior scale for the global shrinkage parameter; e.g. \code{prior_rhs = c(slab_df = 15, slab_scale = 5, scale_global = 0.5)}. If \code{p0} is provided and prior_rhs is missing, \code{p0} will be used automatically to calculate \code{scale_global}, \code{slab_df} will be set to 15, and \code{slab_scale} will be set to be weakly informative automatically based on the scale of the data.}

\item{prior_nu}{Set the parameters for the Gamma prior distribution on the degrees of freedom in the likelihood function when using \code{family = student_t}. Defaults to \code{prior_nu = c(alpha = 3, beta = 0.2)}.}

\item{prior_tau}{Set hyperparameters for the scale parameter of exchangeable random effects/varying intercepts (\code{alpha_re}). The random effects are given a normal prior with scale parameter \code{alpha_tau}. The latter is given a half-Student's t prior with default of 20 degrees of freedom, centered on zero and scaled to the data to be weakly informative. To adjust it use, e.g., \code{prior_tau = c(df = 20, location = 0, scale = 5)}.}

\item{centerx}{Should the covariates be centered prior to fitting the model? Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{scalex}{Should the covariates be centered and scaled (divided by their standard deviation)? Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{prior_only}{Draw samples from the prior distributions of parameters only.}

\item{chains}{Number of MCMC chains to estimate. Default \code{chains = 4}.}

\item{iter}{Number of samples per chain. Default \code{iter = 2000}.}

\item{refresh}{Stan will print the progress of the sampler every \code{refresh} number of samples. Defaults to \code{500}; set \code{refresh=0} to silence this.}

\item{pars}{Optional; specify any additional parameters you'd like stored from the Stan model. Parameters from the RHS priors include \code{tau} (the global shrinkage parameter) and \code{lambda} (the local shrinkage parameter).}

\item{control}{A named list of parameters to control the sampler's behavior. See \link[rstan]{stan} for details. The defaults are the same \code{rstan::stan} except that \code{adapt_delta} is raised to \code{.99} and \code{max_treedepth = 15}.}

\item{silent}{If \code{TRUE}, suppress printed messages including prior specifications and Stan sampling progress (i.e. \code{refresh=0}). Stan's error and warning messages will still print.}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed to \link[rstan]{sampling}.}

\description{
Fit a spatial regression model using eigenvector spatial filtering.
}
\details{
Eigenvector spatial filtering is extensivly covered in Griffith et al. (2019). This function implements the methodology introduced in Donegan et al. (2020), drawing on the Piironen and Vehtari's (2017) regularized horseshoe prior. ESF models take the spectral decomposition of the doubly-centered spatial connectivity matrix \code{C}, which appears in the numerator of the Moran coefficient (MC),a measure of spatial autocorrelation. The resulting eigenvectors \code{EV} are mutually orthogonal and uncorrelated map patterns. ESF methodology is premised on our ability to decompose spatial autocorrelation into a linear combination of various patterns, typically at different scales (such as local, regional, and global trends). SA in the outcome variable is then absorbed by the spatial filter \code{EV * beta_ev}, where \code{beta_ev} is a vector of coefficients.

ESF decomposes the data into a global mean \code{alpha}, global patterns contributed by covariates \code{X * beta}, spatial trends \code{EV * beta_ev}, and residual variation. Thus

\code{ Mu = intercept + X * beta + EV * beta_ev }

and for the Gaussian model,

\code{Y \~ Gauss(Mu, sigma) }

The model can easily be extended to the space-time domain; see \link[geostan]{shape2mat} to specify a space-time connectivity matrix. 

The coefficients \code{beta_ev} are assigned the regularized horseshoe prior (Piironen and Vehtari, 2017), resulting in a relatively sparse model specification. In addition, numerous eigenvectors are automatically dropped because they represent trace amounts of spatial autocorrelation (this is controlled by the \code{threshold} argument). By default, \code{stan_esf} will drop all eigenvectors representing negative spatial autocorrelation patterns. You can change this behavior using the \code{nsa} argument.
